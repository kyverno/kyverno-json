Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType\n  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.\nImplementations are required to support all path types.\n\nPossible enum values:\n - `\"Exact\"` matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.\n - `\"ImplementationSpecific\"` matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.\n - `\"Prefix\"` matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'.

A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path.

If multiple matching paths exist in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path is given priority. Examples: - /foo/bar does not match requests to /foo/barbaz - /foo/bar matches request to /foo/bar and /foo/bar/baz - /foo and /foo/ both match requests to /foo and /foo/. If both paths are present in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path (/foo/) is given priority.",
